# Notes-Making-App

<b> Project Description: </b>

This app has a simple user interface made using jetpack compose, for making notes and order them as per user demand. user can choose between diferent colours to 
differentiate the notes.

<b> How to use the project: </b>

You need not to make an id to use the app, just open it, hit the '+' button, select the colour of your note as per your liking. after that enter the title and the note 
itslef. at last save the note.

<b> Future Scope: </b>

Further improvements can be done in the app regarding functionality and UI. An important feature I look forward to add is the notification feature- You can set an 
appointment or any thing that u have to do at a particular time, in the app itself and the app will notify you at the right time so that u don't miss any important work.
